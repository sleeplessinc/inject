		<h1> Example Page #1 </h1>

		All of these example pages present the same data found in data.js, however
		each page is very different.
		The only thing that changes is the html and the css.
		The javascript code that injects the data into the page is 100% the same.

		<h2>Simple Injection</h2>

		These 2 links are injected from JSON data:
		<ul>
			<li id=menuitem><a href="__page__">__label__</a>
		</ul>


		<h2>Some Interesting Data</h2>

		The data in this table is injected once at on page load, and then changed by
		resetting and re-injecting a different set of data a few seconds later.
		<p>

		<table border=1>
			<tr >
				<td><b>Column 1</b></td>
				<td><b>Column 2</b></td>
				<td><b>Column 3</b></td>
			</tr>
			<tr id=protodiv>
				<td>__heading__</td>
				<td>__name__</td>
				<td>__when__</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<h2>Nested Injections</h2>

		This section demonstrates how to replicate data within another replicated
		section.  In other words, recursive replication.  This is done with a little
		assistance of jquery (see demo.js).

		<div id=sec_tmpl>
			<h3>__section__</h3>
			<ul >
				<li> <b>__name__</b> <br> __desc__ </li>
			</ul>
		</div>
